## PART I: The Power of Psychological Safety

### 1. The Underpinning

**Psychological safety** is affirmed as the most critical dynamic for successful teams, forming the **underpinning** for all other positive group characteristics, based on research like that conducted at Google.

The absence of psychological safety is illustrated by Christina Price, a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner, who withheld suggesting a necessary **prophylactic surfactant** for high-risk newborns. Her silence was a reaction to having previously witnessed the neonatologist publicly berate another nurse for questioning an order.

#### Unconscious Calculators

Christina's hesitation was a rapid, unconscious **risk calculation**—a **micro-assessment** prioritizing immediate **interpersonal risks** over professional responsibility. This tendency is called **discounting the future**: overvaluing the immediate risk of being publicly belittled and underweighting the long-term risk to patient health.

This behavior aligns with Erving Goffman’s theory on **The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life**, where individuals constantly manage their image to avoid looking ignorant, incompetent, or disruptive. These are the **interpersonal risks** that people instinctively avoid:

* **Avoiding questions** to prevent looking ignorant.
* **Concealing mistakes** to prevent looking incompetent.
* **Withholding suggestions** to avoid appearing disruptive.

While image management protects the individual, it severely compromises organizational performance, leading to **thwarted innovation**, poor service, and catastrophic failures, even resulting in the **loss of human life** (e.g., in aviation, finance, and healthcare). This fear of speaking up affects all levels; for instance, a Chief Financial Officer with grave reservations about an acquisition remained silent, fearing being "the skunk at the picnic." The overall cost of silence is organizational risk, preventable accidents, and unnecessary deaths.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Psychological Safety:** The fundamental dynamic for high-performing teams.
* **Interpersonal Risks:** The risks individuals seek to avoid at work: looking ignorant, incompetent, or disruptive.
* **Risk Calculation/Micro-assessment:** The unconscious process of weighing the risk of speaking up against the risk of remaining silent.
* **Discounting the Future:** The cognitive tendency to overweight immediate social consequences (e.g., confrontation) and underweight more important, long-term outcomes (e.g., organizational failure).
* **Consequence of Silence:** Thwarted innovation, poor service quality, and preventable, life-threatening accidents.

#### Envisioning the Psychologically Safe Workplace

A **psychologically safe workplace** is defined as the belief that the work environment is **safe for interpersonal risk taking** . This climate, characterized by a blend of **trust and respect**, makes **speaking up**—the act of raising ideas, questions, concerns, feedback, or admitting errors—a natural and expected behavior.

In a safe environment, Christina Price would have routinely asked the neonatologist about the medication. The outcome would be positive regardless: either the patients receive life-saving care, or the team learns from the doctor's rationale. Beyond error correction, psychological safety encourages proactive contributions, such as suggesting system-level improvements (e.g., instituting a new NICU protocol).

The failure to speak up is typically caused by **interpersonal fear**, a silent deterrent to the free exchange of ideas, often going unnoticed by management.

Crucially, **psychological safety is a property of a group**, not just the relationship between two specific individuals. This means that within a single organization, distinct groups can possess highly varied **interpersonal climates**—some encouraging voice and others enforcing silence. These localized differences powerfully shape employee behavior, confirming that this concept is an advance on earlier models of individual image management like Goffman's *face-saving*.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Psychological Safety:** The belief that the work environment is **safe for interpersonal risk taking**.
* **Climate Composition:** A combination of **trust and respect**.
* **Speaking Up:** Open, authentic communication including raising concerns, giving feedback, and admitting errors.
* **Organizational Benefit:** Facilitates **learning**, shines light on problems, and increases **knowledge sharing**.
* **Group Property:** Psychological safety is an **emergent property of a group** (team or unit) that varies locally, shaping distinct **interpersonal climates** within an organization.

#### An Accidental Discovery

The initial study of **psychological safety** began as an **accidental discovery** while researching **medical error rates** in hospitals. The researcher hypothesized that **effective teams** (measured by a **team diagnostic survey** of collaboration and respect) would have the **fewest errors**.

Data collection was kept independent: error rates were gathered by medical experts, and team effectiveness scores were gathered via survey.

The result was **counter-intuitive**: teams that scored highest on effectiveness had **significantly higher reported error rates** (up to a ten-fold difference). This led to the crucial insight: the "better" teams weren't making more mistakes; they simply had an **open climate** that encouraged **reporting** and discussing errors.

A subsequent "blind" study confirmed that the variation in reported errors correlated perfectly with the team's perceived ability to **talk about mistakes**. This climate of openness was later termed **psychological safety**.

Further research confirmed that **psychological safety varies across groups** within all types of organizations, is influenced by **local leaders**, and is a strong predictor of **learning behavior** and **objective performance** (including lower mortality). This established that psychological safety is a **group-level phenomenon**.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Accidental Discovery:** Initial research unexpectedly found that high team effectiveness correlated with high **reported error rates**.
* **Core Concept:** High reporting is a measure of an **open climate** that encourages **speaking up**, later defined as **psychological safety**.
* **Group-Level Phenomenon:** Psychological safety is a property that varies significantly **across work groups** and is driven by **local leaders**.
* **Predictive Value:** Psychological safety predicts **learning behavior** and **objective performance** across industries.

#### Standing on Giants' Shoulders

The importance of **psychological safety** has theoretical roots dating back to the early 1960s, building upon the work of several seminal organizational scholars.

* **Edgar Schein and Warren Bennis (1965):** They identified psychological safety as essential for coping with the **uncertainty and anxiety** of **organizational change**. Schein later noted it helps people overcome **"learning anxiety"** and defensiveness, allowing them to focus on shared goals rather than **self-protection**.
* **William Kahn (1990):** His research established that psychological safety, alongside **meaningfulness**, fosters **employee engagement**. Kahn highlighted that people are more likely to express themselves and take risks when they believe they will be **given the benefit of the doubt**, which is reinforced by experiencing **trust and respect** at work.

The researcher's own dissertation work then introduced and tested the concept as a **group-level phenomenon**. Building on the discovery from the hospital error study, a subsequent study of 51 teams in a manufacturing company confirmed that psychological safety varied significantly across teams and enabled both **team learning behaviors** and improved **team performance**.

A critical insight is that psychological safety is not a personality trait, but a **feature of the workplace** that **leaders must create**. Across all studied organizations, psychological safety was found to differ substantially from group to group, indicating it is shaped by the effectiveness of **local leaders** in establishing the right conditions.

This research reinforces that all employees are subject to subtle but constant **interpersonal risks** (being perceived as ignorant, incompetent, or intrusive) during routine actions like asking questions or offering ideas. While the unwillingness to take these small risks can destroy organizational value, psychological safety provides the environment needed to mitigate this fear. The ultimate goal is to create a workplace where individuals are more afraid of **failing the customer** than of **looking bad** in front of colleagues.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Edgar Schein:** Linked psychological safety to overcoming **learning anxiety** and enabling focus on **shared goals** during organizational change.
* **William Kahn:** Linked psychological safety (the belief in being **given the benefit of the doubt**) to higher **employee engagement** and self-expression.
* **Dissertation Finding:** Confirmed psychological safety is a **group-level phenomenon** that drives **team learning behaviors** and **team performance**.
* **Leader Responsibility:** Psychological safety is a feature of the workplace, not personality, and must be created by **local leaders**.
* **Mitigation of Risk:** Psychological safety helps mitigate **interpersonal risk** (fear of looking bad) so employees prioritize **customer/organizational success** over self-protection.

#### Why Fear Is Not an Effective Motivator

Fear is an **ineffective motivator** for contemporary work that requires **learning, creativity, or collaboration**. While fear may have motivated workers in simple, repetitive assembly-line tasks, it actively undermines performance in complex, knowledge-based roles.

**Brain science** provides the neurophysiological basis for this:

* **Inhibited Learning:** Fear activates the **amygdala**, the brain's threat detector, triggering automatic stress responses. This consumes physiologic resources and diverts them from the prefrontal cortex, which handles **working memory**, **analytic thinking**, and **problem solving**. This impairs the ability to learn and process new information.
* **Reduced Cooperation:** Fear inhibits the behaviors necessary for collective success.

Consequently, a person's level of **psychological safety** determines their likelihood of engaging in crucial **learning behaviors** such as asking for help, sharing information, and experimenting, and also affects employee satisfaction.

**Hierarchy**—when poorly managed—contributes to fear and reduces psychological safety. Lower-status members consistently feel less safe due to an unconscious, constant assessment of their status relative to others. The presence of higher-status individuals often induces stress in subordinates.

Psychological safety, conversely, is a **belief** that the consequences of interpersonal risks (e.g., admitting failure, asking for help) will **not be punitive**; rather, **candor is both allowed and expected**. It creates an environment where people can speak up, offer ideas, and ask questions without fear of punishment or embarrassment.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Fear as Motivator:** Ineffective for knowledge-based work requiring **learning** and **collaboration**.
* **Neuroscientific Basis:** Fear activates the **amygdala**, consuming resources and impairing higher-order functions like **working memory** and **analytic thinking**.
* **Impact on Behavior:** Psychological safety is crucial as it determines the propensity for essential **learning behaviors** (e.g., asking for help, sharing information).
* **Hierarchy and Status:** Poorly managed hierarchy reduces psychological safety; **lower-status members** experience greater stress and fear.
* **Psychological Safety Definition:** A belief that taking **interpersonal risks** will not result in **punitive consequences**, making candor expected.

#### What Psychological Safety Is Not

There are four key misconceptions about **psychological safety**:

1. **Not About Being Nice:** Psychological safety is not synonymous with politeness or avoiding conflict. It is about **candor** and enabling **productive disagreement** and the **free exchange of ideas** necessary for learning and innovation. In a safe environment, people openly discuss conflicts rather than resorting to "hallway talk."
2. **Not a Personality Factor:** It is not a synonym for **extroversion** or confidence. Psychological safety refers to the **work climate** and affects individuals similarly, regardless of personality traits like introversion or extroversion.
3. **Not Just Another Word for Trust:** While related, they are distinct. **Psychological safety** is a **group-level phenomenon** describing the immediate expectation of **interpersonal consequences** (e.g., *Will I be humiliated if I ask for help now?*). **Trust**, conversely, is an **individual-level belief** about a specific target's future actions (e.g., *Will this person uphold their promise in the future?*).
4. **Not About Lowering Performance Standards:** Psychological safety is not an "anything goes" environment. It is **conducive** to setting **ambitious goals** and **high standards** because it enables the **candor** and collaboration needed to achieve them. Managers who equate psychological safety with relaxing accountability fundamentally misunderstand the concept.

Psychological safety and **Performance Standards** are two separate, critical dimensions that define the work climate, as shown in the **Psychological Safety vs. Performance Standards Framework**.

* **Apathy Zone (Low Safety, Low Standards):** Employees prioritize self-protection and discretionary effort is absent.
* **Comfort Zone (High Safety, Low Standards):** Employees are collegial and open but lack challenge, leading to limited learning or innovation.
* **Anxiety Zone (Low Safety, High Standards):** This is highly common and problematic. High standards combined with a lack of safety (especially in a **VUCA** environment characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) create **interpersonal anxiety** and risk suboptimal performance or disaster.
* **Learning & High Performance Zone (High Safety, High Standards):** This is the ideal state for complex and uncertain work, where candor, collaboration, and learning actively drive effective high performance.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Misconception 1:** Psychological safety is about **candor** and **productive conflict**, not merely "being nice."
* **Misconception 2:** It is a **work climate factor**, not a **personality factor** (e.g., extroversion).
* **Misconception 3:** It differs from **trust**; psychological safety is **group-level** and concerns **immediate interpersonal risk**, while trust is **individual-level** and concerns **future expectations**.
* **Misconception 4:** It **enables** high standards and accountability; it does not lower them.
* **Framework:** The **Psychological Safety vs. Performance Standards Framework** defines four zones:
  * **Anxiety Zone:** Low Safety/High Standards (Common and dangerous in a **VUCA** world).
  * **Learning & High Performance Zone:** High Safety/High Standards (Ideal for complex work).

#### Measuring Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is commonly measured using **surveys**, with a widely-used instrument consisting of seven items developed in the author’s dissertation . These items utilize a seven-point **Likert scale** (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree). Four items are positively worded (agreement indicates safety), and three items are negatively worded (disagreement indicates safety, marked with an **R** for reverse scoring).

The seven core survey items are:

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you. (R)
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different. (R)
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help. (R)
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

The measure is considered **robust**, demonstrating necessary statistical properties such as **inter-item reliability** (measured by Cronbach's alpha) and **predictive validity** (correlation with other variables). The instrument has been successfully translated and validated in numerous languages.

Beyond surveys, psychological safety can be measured qualitatively:

* **Interview Data Coding:** In case studies, interview responses can be analyzed to detect the presence or absence of psychological safety.
* **Hypothetical Scenarios/Vignettes:** Interviewees or survey respondents are presented with gray-area scenarios and asked how they or their colleagues would respond. Confidentiality is crucial for obtaining candid reports regarding whether individuals would **hold back** from speaking up. This approach can be scaled up using vignettes for a larger sample size than individual interviews permit.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Measurement Method:** Most popular method is **surveys** using a **Likert scale**.
* **Reverse Scoring:** Required for negatively worded survey items (e.g., "mistakes are held against you") to ensure consistency in data analysis.
* **Measure Robustness:** The instrument possesses strong **statistical properties**, including **inter-item reliability** (Cronbach's alpha) and **predictive validity**.
* **Qualitative Methods:** Include coding of **interview data** and using **hypothetical scenarios/vignettes** to assess willingness to speak up in ambiguous situations.

#### Psychological Safety Is Not Enough

**Psychological safety** alone is insufficient for achieving **high performance**. It functions by "taking off the brakes," enabling risk-taking and learning, but it is **not the sole source of motivation** ("the fuel").

In challenging industries, leaders have two essential, concurrent tasks:

1. **Build Psychological Safety:** To foster learning and prevent avoidable failures.
2. **Set High Standards:** To inspire and enable people to achieve excellence, emphasizing a **worthy purpose**.

In modern **knowledge work**, achieving excellence cannot be easily ensured through traditional methods like inspecting *widgets* or simply measuring final results, as outcomes are often uncertain and complex processes are difficult to measure reliably. Therefore, 21st-century leadership must focus on **motivating and coaching** employees, making excellence a rewarding experience. The most crucial, and often overlooked, leadership responsibility in this context is making the work environment safe for **open communication** about challenges, concerns, and opportunities.

---

**Key Points:**

* **Psychological Safety's Role:** It removes barriers ("takes off the brakes") to learning and risk-taking, but is not the sole motivator ("the fuel").
* **Dual Leadership Tasks:** Leaders must simultaneously (1) build **psychological safety** and (2) **set and enable high standards** while articulating a **worthy purpose**.
* **Modern Work Challenge:** In **knowledge work**, excellence is hard to measure incrementally, making intrinsic motivation and feedback essential.
* **Core Leadership Responsibility:** Creating an environment safe for **open communication** about challenges is vital for success in complex, uncertain environments.
